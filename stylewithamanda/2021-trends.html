                    <h2>Pastels</h2>
                    <p>Pastels always come back into style during the spring season, but this spring season I predict that pastels will be mixed with neon colors. For example, neon pink and pastel yellow or neon blue and pastel orange. Neons and pastels will be combined with each other to create unique looks. I predict that this trend will be used for nail art and accessorizing.</p>

                    <h2>Sage Green</h2>
                    <p>This color has been trending recently and I think it will only continue. Sage green is perfect for accessories, such as a bag or a belt. Also, I predict sage green will be used a lot in home decor, such as for candles and vases.</p>

                    <h2>Cow Print</h2>
                    <p>Cow print has been in recently, but I predict it will blow up with colors. For example, a white background with purple cow print. Also, light, dark, and white combined to make cow print. I predict this for accessories, such as bags, for nails, and for home decor, such as a rug or throw blanket.</p>

                    <h2>Neutrals</h2>
                    <p>I predict that neutral browns and greens mixed with patterns and neons will become a trend and used when styling outfits.</p>

                    <h2>Red</h2>
                    <p>Red is a bold color and I see it coming back to become a main color people are drawn to when buying new clothes.</p>

                    <h2>Metallics</h2>
                    <p>Metallics, specifically silver, will be seen heavily in accessorizing. For example, I predict that metallic bags will be trending.</p>

                    <h2>Funky Ass Style!</h2>
                    <p>Because the pandemic is starting to die down and people are getting vaccinated, I predict that people will experiment with their style and draw inspiration from the 70s and wear fun outfits. Additionally, I predict that people will be seen wearing fun makeup and using makeup as an accessory.</p>

                    <h9>Headbands</h9>
                    <p>I predict that headbands will come back in style. Soft and hard headbands, but especially design headbands.</p>

                    <h2>Chunky Rings</h2>
                    <p>I predict that clay and plastic chunky rings in fun or neon colors will be trending.</p>
