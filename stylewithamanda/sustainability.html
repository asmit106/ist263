                <h2>What is sustainability?</h2>
                <p>Before I explain sustainable fashion, the term sustainability needs to be defined. Sustainability focuses on the ability to maintain a certain rate based on the economy, society, and the environment. The objective of sustainability is to avoid depleting our natural resources.</p>
                <p>Most of the time sustainability is thought of solely as an environmental movement; however, it is necessary for every aspect of our daily life. For example, sustainability needs to be enforced within the food industry, everyday energy consumption, and everyday product consumption. On the note of product consumption, fashion is an area of substantial improvement.</p>

            <h2>The unsustainable fashion industry</h2>
            <p>Fashion is one of the main polluting industries globally. The responsibility for this lies not only with the manufacturers but also with the consumers. The manufacturers pick out the fabrics and how the product is made, but the consumers decide what supply is in demand. If fast fashion is in demand, then unsustainable manufacturing practices take precedence.</p>

            <h2>Fast fashion</h2>
            <p>Fast fashion is the practice of producing what’s trendy. Fast fashion cycles through trends and is manufactured in bulk, even if unnecessary. Once the trend has died down, the leftover garments are disposed of. Most of the time, more garments are going to waste than being sold. The reason fast fashion is so popular is that it is cheap to manufacture and cheap to purchase. However, don’t be fooled by the lower price tag because Mother Earth has to pay the real cost.</p>

                <h2>How can you take part in sustainable fashion</h2>
                <p>Sustainable fashion does not need to be expensive. In fact, you can save money shopping sustainability. Rethink how you buy, dispose, and make.</p>

                <h3>Buy</h3>
                <p>Buy smarter. Buy second hand. Go thrifting in person or online using apps such as Depop and Poshmark.</p>

                <h3>Dispose</h3>
                <p>Instead of throwing out old clothes, you can give them to friends, donate them locally, or sell them on one of the apps listed above. The current throw-away culture is detrimental to our planet, so do anything to keep your old clothes out of landfills.</p>

                <h3>Make</h3>
                <p>Before getting rid of old clothes, see if you can revamp them. Recycle and recreate a new item out of an old one.</p>
