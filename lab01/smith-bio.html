<title>Amanda Smith - Bio</title>
<body>
20-years-young, my name is Amanda Smith. I am a graphic design major who is passionate about fashion and sustainability. Currently, I am working on freelance and personal projects. I design graphic artwork for the Syracuse Menâ€™s Basketball team and recently completed a branding project for a local organizing company, including a set of logos, a business card, and a website. I am knowledgeable of all social media platforms and in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. 

My hobbies include shopping, browsing Pinterest, working out, and being around my friends. My favorite TV shows are Big Little Lies, Sharp Objects, and Game of Thrones. My favorite movies are The Professional, Inception, The Great Gatsby, Blue Crush, and Pulp Fiction. 

I am a middle child with two sisters who are my best friends and there for me 24/7. I am a diehard Lisa Frank fan and my most prized possession is her sticker book. I love music and use Spotify more than any other social media. I am a creative person who thinks in music and colors.
